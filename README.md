## Task 3 — Fix Repository Name in URL

The issue is your repo is named `Git-Hub-Course-Era-Final-Project` but it should be named **`github-final-project`**.

You have two options:

### Option A: Rename your existing repo (Easiest)
1. Go to your repo on GitHub
2. Click **"Settings"** (top menu)
3. Under **"Repository name"** change it to `github-final-project`
4. Click **"Rename"**

Your URL will then become:
```
